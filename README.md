# customer satisfaction (mlops)
**Problem statement**: For a given customer's historical data, we are tasked to predict the review score for the next order or purchase. We will be using the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). This dataset has information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing charges from various dimensions: from order status, price, payment, freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally, reviews written by customers. The objective here is to predict the customer satisfaction score for a given order based on features like order status, price, payment, etc.
